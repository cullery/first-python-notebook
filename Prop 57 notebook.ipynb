    "# Prop 57 notebook\n",
    "This is my data analysis for Proposition 57 in California during the 2016 election. The notebook was created as part of a discussion forum assignment for the Python for Data Journalists class taught by Ben Welsh of the L.A. Times data desk during summer 2017. In this notebook, I took two data tables provided by the California Civic Data Coalition to analyze political contributions for a proposition that would change California's prison sentencing. Prop 57 passed in California with over 8 million votes on Nov. 8.\n",
    "In this notebook, I review the contributions made to see if Prop 57 supporting contributors outweighed the money raised by the opposition, and who raised the most. "

After that, I read in the .csv file provided by the CCDC of the 102 committees supporting or opposing 17 propositions, and then reviewed them for some general information. "

Initially, I wanted to know how much money in total was raised by both sides on Prop 57 and found that $20,097,369. I then wanted to know how many contributions were made for and against Prop 57, and here I found something interesting. Where we previously saw there were many more 11 supporting committees and two opposed, nearly an 80/20 split, here we see the contributors flipped that with 146 against and 91 supporting, almost a 60/40 split.
